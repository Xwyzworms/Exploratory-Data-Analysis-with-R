#8.Plotting Systems
- They three systems of plotting
- 1. Base plotting system
- 2. The lattice system
- 3. ggplot2 system

#This Section Cover the Base Plotting System#

##8.1 The Base Plotting System#
  - load by default
  - Build the blank Canvas :D
  - Plot ,then Annotate it :D

##8.2 The Lattice System
  - Required to load Library(lattice) Loaded.
  - Created with a Single Function Call ,You feed the arguments all at once
    - You can't modified spacing,margins and etc.
  - Useful for **conditional** plots. i.e looking at how y changes with x across levels of z. These types of plots are useful for looking at multidimensional data and often allow you to squeeze a lot of information into a single window or page.

##8.3 GGPLOT2 System##
 - base + lattice = GGPLOT2
 - So you can do plotting, annotating ,conditioning as you want.
