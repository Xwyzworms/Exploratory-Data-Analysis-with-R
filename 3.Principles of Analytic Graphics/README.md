# Principles of Analytic Graphics

## Key Note :

  * Show Comparisons
    * # Just Do Comparisons , Ask "Compare to what ?" -- You get more information by doing this
  * Show causality,mechanism,explanation,systematic structure
    * # Key Note Here is that you need to know "Why" ,after you compare / analyze something you should ask "Why?" my answer like that ,is something related ?
  * Show multivariate Data
    * You Should build attempt to build data graph that shows information as much as possible,even with 2D data graphics. What do i mean by that ?
      * For instance you want to plot daily death because starving , you should go deeper ,into that "Starving" ,for instance the County .You Plotted that out .And you get daily death because starving in county X data graphics. **"Plot information as much as possible :D"**
  * Integrate evidence
    * This is just add more information to make your plot more easy to understand such as add images/words/anything that related to your plot.
  * Describe and document the evidence
    * You get it right ? Adding Title/xaxis/yaxis and also what is this plots show ?
  * Content , content <CONTENT!!!!>
    *  *Starting with a good question, developing a sound approach, and only presenting information that is necessary for answering that question, is essential to every data graphic.*
    * So note in here.Your graphic content is need to suitable with "question" you wanna ask?It's Obvio right?
