# 13.K-Means Clustering

## it's short but well to know deep dive into Cluster analysis when you dealing with data .
- [Code](https://github.com/Xwyzworms/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/10.K-Means%20Clustering/Kmeans.R)
- The basic idea is that you are trying to find the centroids of a fixed number of clusters of points in a high-dimensional space
How the Algorithm works :
1. Specify number of clusters at some integer DONT try 1 :D
2. Randomize The Centroids.
3. Assign the observation that close to centroids
4. Re calculate centroid position and repeat. <The Best Variant?> w

Kmeans will try to find the best Variants ,You should look at the book.
