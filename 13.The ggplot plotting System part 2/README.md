# 16.The ggplot2 plotting system : Part 2

## We're Going to deep dive into The inside of qplots ,ggplot2.

## 16.1 Basic Components of a ggplot2 Plot
[Code]()
A ggplot2 plot consists of a number of key components. Here are a few of the more commonly used :
• data frame: stores all of the data that will be displayed on the plot
• aesthetic mappings: describe how data are mapped to color, size, shape, location,ect.
• geoms: geometric objects like points, lines, shapes.
• facets: describes how categorical variable plots should be constructed
• stats: statistical transformations like binning, quantiles, smoothing. <Statistika pak>
• scales: what scale an aesthetic map uses (example: male = red, female = blue) .
• coordinate system: describes the system in which the locations of the geoms will be drawn

  3. Add metadata and annotation (*Unlimited*)
  4. Back to 1
