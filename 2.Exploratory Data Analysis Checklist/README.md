## The Rest Checklist Available here :

## Formulate Your Question
 - Make your Question sharp, why ?  it's easy to work with
 Example : Are Indonesians attitude in Bandung is better than in Jakarta  OR
 Are Indonesians attitude in west java is better than in East Java ? Which is will make your life easy ? Of course you can ask the second question , but remember to think about your question that your intrested in and NARROW it down .  
 So here's My suggestion : - 1. Find sharp question at least then Try to understand the result. after that make it sharp and stick with your question while you dive into it.
 * In this book the question we want to answer
  * *Which Countries in the United States have the Highest levels of ambient ozone pollution*.Of course you can sharp this question

  * Note : When Doing EDA it's important to ask *"Do I have the right data to answer this question?"* , it will clear if we look at the data.

## Read in Your data , Just Read it.
  * Try to use library(readr) --> Much Faster than R's built in functions.
  * Note for readcsv function : argument coltypes-->for specify the types of each columns/features:

## Check the packaging
  * Check your data ,is it same as the knowledge you get before ?
  * nrow() and ncol() can help you with it

## Run STR()
  * Check your features/variables/columns data types in general.
  * STR() function will Show general Summary of your data set.

## Look at the top and the Bottom of your Data
  * it's obvious

## Check your "n"s
  * find it really hard to grasp.
    * I was thinking this is just your expectations didnt meet with the data you have.
## Validate With at least on External data source
      * means you need to compare your data with real world threshold/such as concentration / behaviour . See the example  ?
##  Try the easy solution first
  * Its obvious i guess

## Challenge Your solution  
  * Yep after yo answer your question,try to Challenge it ,go deeper.
## Follow up question
  * Do you have the right data?
  * Do you need other data?
  * Do You Have Right Question ?
